*** Interactive CLI scipt to power ESXi VMs once ***

I made this script too ease my power on my development environments on my home server as i have environments with 5+ VMs.

the idea is to store my environment VMs in a file then i select one off environment to power on .

so this script consist of two files one for the the script itself "environment_Control.py" and another "environments.json" where i store the environments names and related VMs IDS.

hope you enjoy it and learn me if we can make more simpler.
